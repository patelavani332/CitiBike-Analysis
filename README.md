## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the website https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

Here a set of data visualizations are generated and analyzed for the Jersey City.

## Resources

* Tableau public 

## Steps

Designed visualizations for discovered phenomena (4-10 total). I worked with the data for months June 2022 and Jan 2023 and merged those data sets accordingly.

The following are some questions I chose to analyze for Jersey City.

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?
* What is the most used bike type by type of members?
* What are th Top stations having riders using electric bikes?
* By what percentage has total ridership affected in january 2023 compared to June 2022?
* What are the peak hours in which bike are used in June vs January?
* How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
* What is the total duration covered by electric and classic bikes per station?

## My vizualizations

### Dashboard 1

* Observations: Most used station to start and end the trip was Grove St PATH and June 2022 has more rides compared to January 2023 due to warm weather in June.

### Dashboard 2

* Observations: 107,850 classic bikes, 1225 docked bikes and 50,299 electric bikes are used in total. Maximum Electric rides used by riders is at Hoboken Terminal - hudson  ST and Hudson PI station. Also count of member riders is more than the count of casual riders. Also use of classic bikes is high compared to docked and electric bikes. But use of electric bikes is also noticable and can be increased in future.

### Dashboard 3

* Observations: Rides taken in June 2020 is 64.82% whereas rides taken in Jan 2023 is only 35.18%. This could be because of colder weather in January. Also peak hours for June and January are mostly 8 AM in the morning and 6 PM in the evening in June and 5 PM in the evening in January.

### Bottom 10 end stations

### Total rides during June vs January

Observations: Total 103,299 rides are taken in June 2022 and 56,075 rides are taken in January 2023. This is because January has very cold weather conditions and June is a Summer month so people are more comfortable in riding bikes in summer months compared to winter months.

### Duration covered by electric and classic bikes per station

Observations: Total duration covered by the riders using classic bikes is more compared to electric bikes and South Waterfront Walkway- Sinatra Dr & 1st station has the highest total duration covered from all the starting stations.
